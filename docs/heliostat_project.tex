{\bfseries{Description}} 

This electro-\/mechanical design project utilized a combination of mechanical design, manufacturing, electronic PCB design, and microcontroller programming to produce an automated heliostat that is capable of determing the direction of a lightsource and then calculating the angle of a mirror to reflect the light to a specified position. This project required us to develop everything from scratch. This included developing electronic PCB designs for the microcontroller and external electronics from scratch along with sourcing electro-\/mechanical components like motors and electronics. The programming took place in STM32\+Cube\+IDE, programming in C.



{\bfseries{ My Role and Takeaways }}

The main challenge of this project was learning and researching how to design a PCB. I worked through Autodesk Fusion 360 to create schematics and board layouts with parts that I sourced through Digi\+Key. Ensuring electronic components would work in the design required reading through datasheets along with common applications and verifying appropriate lead times would be met for boards and electronics. I also had to learn how to program the microcontroller for the various components we needed, including motors and servos, radio recievers, IMUs, and photoresistors.

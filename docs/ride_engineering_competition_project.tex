{\bfseries{Description}} 

The two competition projects that I worked on at the Cal Poly Amusement Park Engineer and Designers (CAPED) club were both to design a functioning scaled-\/down rollercoaster within ASTM F2291 standards. The two designs that were developed can be seen below and had a focus on safety and ingenuity while working around existing designs. This included E-\/stops, redundent mechanical and control safety features, and braking mechanisms. At the same time, we wanted to design something new but obtainable, leading us to the final designs.





{\bfseries{ My Role and Takeaways }}

These projects were my first real experience working on a multidiscipline team for a long-\/term project. I worked on the team as both a controls member for the 2022 project, where I learned the basics of microcontrollers and E-\/stop mechanisms, and a mechanical staff for the 2023 project, where I applied CAD for various designs and advanced geometry. A significant challenge with these designs was manufacturing capabilities. I had to develop track designs that would not only work structurally and allow the vehicle to maintain enough energy to overcome friction at high force regions such as turns, but also be manufacturable through the processes available at the school like tube bending, waterjet cutting, and welding. This often involved having discussions with mechanical, manufacturing, and electronic leads to ensure that the design would work as they needed it.

This research and design project was sponsored by Solar Turbines, an international gas engine and engine maintenance provider. My team was tasked to develop a mechanical sealing method to seal a region between one of their turbine engine\textquotesingle{}s combustion liner and turbine nozzle. The challenges of this design included extreme temperature environments where thermal expansion and non-\/linear properties needed to be considered, large nominal diameters with small geometric features, and predefined assembly processes that the design needed to fulfill. My team worked through various designs and determined an E-\/seal design to be the most appropriate for the situation. A small-\/scale prototype was manufactured with an E-\/seal provided by JETSEAL, a seal vendor, and test plans were developed and applied to produce leak rates for various scenarios.

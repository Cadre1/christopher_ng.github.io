{\bfseries{Description}} 

This research and design project was sponsored by Solar Turbines, an international gas engine and engine maintenance provider. My team was tasked with developing a mechanical sealing method to seal a region between one of their turbine engine\textquotesingle{}s combustion liner and turbine nozzle. The challenges of this design included extreme temperature environments where thermal expansion and non-\/linear properties needed to be considered, large nominal diameters with small geometric features, and predefined assembly processes that the design needed to fulfill. Over the year, my team conducted research on existing designs and analyzed various designs of our own to determine that an E-\/seal design was the most appropriate solution based off of Solar Turbines\textquotesingle{} needs for the situation. A small-\/scale prototype was manufactured with an E-\/seal provided by JETSEAL, a seal vendor, and test plans were developed and applied to produce leak rates for various scenarios.





{\bfseries{ My Role and Takeaways }}

Over this project, I had the opportunity to really work with a client to develop an idea that worked for their specific needs. We had discussions to help guide the design process, and conduct research to get a grasp on the problem. And after selecting one of many potential designs, I got to use various skills developed through courses, including stress analysis, 3D CAD modeling and drafting, and thermal analysis. This allowed us to justify our design and why we believed it would work through documents such as PDRs and CDRs and formal technical presentations with the sponsor engineers. Once the design was critiqued and reworked, I helped in developing a manufacturing plan and testing plans for a functional prototype. I developed testing procedures and uncertainty calculations to go with raw data collection. We then got to manufacturing the prototype, testing it, and post-\/processing the data to develop comprehensible results.

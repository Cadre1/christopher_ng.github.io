{\bfseries{Description}} 

This thermal-\/fluid design project was intended to develop a combustion chamber that would incorperate regenerative cooling channels along the chamber walls of a previous combustion chamber. This would allow combustion to occur theoretically indefinetly by cooling the walls to prevent them from reaching melting points. The designing of the channels was a key point in ensuring low wall temperatures, ensuring there would be no mechanical pressure failure, and ensuring that the design could be manufactured at less than 1/20th of the scale of a normal combustion chamber. The project was discontinued after management underestimated the scope of the project.



{\bfseries{ My Role and Takeaways }}

With my main role as a designer around the heat transfer that would occur, I had to learn to use a combustion chamber design tool, Rocket Propulsion Analysis (RPA), to develop functioning geometry. I then incorperated the results into a Solid\+Works 3D CAD model and manufacturing drawing. This required that I evaluate the fidelity of the heat transfer and fluid modeling that the program used and begin to model it myself using existing documentation and studies. Scale was a large problem with this design because while a normal combustion chamber could have thin but many channels, our design was limited by the size of end mills, reaching as small as 0.\+010"{} diameters. This, along with other challenges in manufacturing the complex channel shapes, forced us to look into work-\/arounds and reconsider the scope of the project. As one of my earlier experiences with propulsion systems, this helped me learn a bit about the challenges involved and the multitude of components that I had to learn how to analyze.

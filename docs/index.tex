Welcome to Christopher Ng\textquotesingle{}s Main Page!

I am going to be graduating with a BS in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Mechatronics from Cal Poly, SLO (June, 2024). My focus in this field has included electro-\/mechanical system design, programming both for control systems and computational analysis, and thermal and heat transfer.

Containted in this webpage is a list and sources of some of the projects that I have taken a part in. My resume and some additional information about me can also be found here.

{\bfseries{Description}} 

This electro-\/mechanical design project utilized a combination of mechanical design, manufacturing, electronics, and microcontroller programming to produce an automated Nerf turret capable of detecting a human using infared sensors and then panning to aim at the target using closed-\/loop control. This involved applying Solid\+Works 3D CAD modeling to produce parts to either be 3D printed or laser-\/cut, selecting basic electronics such as motors and servos to work with a microcontroller, and closed-\/loop control programming in Python.



{\bfseries{ My Role and Takeaways }}

While I have had experience programming, designing, and working around microcontrollers, this was the first experience being more of a key player in combining them for a project. Within the four weeks, which was reduced due to external situations at Cal Poly, I helped manage my team to develop a design and ensure that it functions as required on time. This involved working with my teammates to finalize mechanical designs and features, making sure every small detail would work; learning how to develop electro-\/mechanical drivers and controllers and utilize communication protocols like UART and I2C to work in Python; and spending timetroubleshooting electro-\/mechanical and programming issues. Documenting problems like gear pitches being too small and IR sensor positioning being too low were things that we learned to recognize during this process to prevent in future designs.

{\bfseries{Description}} 

This thermal-\/fluid design project was a small scale project with the goal to develop a swirl cooling injector that will allow for combustion similar to a normal combustion chamber, but develop a layer of cooling oxidizer between the internal combustion vortex and wall. We developled the design to be operated at low temperatures and pressures which would allow us to use materials that were clear and could achieve complex geometry for us to study the combustion visibly. This involved conducting research about swirl cooling to develop our own design.



{\bfseries{ My Role and Takeaways }}

For this project, I helped manage things like required materials and lead times, Solidworks 3D CAD assemblies, and stress and fluid analysis. This involved working with current club standards and setups to incorperate the new project\textquotesingle{}s design to existing hardware. Apart from 3D printed parts, I looked into vendors to source other required fittings and stock material that would be required based off of the stress analysis for minimum sizes.
